# Scribe MI

##### Python library to manage MI files in Scribe's platform

---

This library allows the management of MI (Monitoring Information) in a simple way.

You first need a Scribe account and an id token. The account can be requested at contact[atsign]scribelabs[dotsign]ai, and the id token can be generated by the user.

---

This library requires a version of Python 3 that supports typings.

pip install scribe-mi

```python
from scribe_Mi import update_id_token

```

### 5. Delete archive by filename

```python

deleted = delete_archive('filename')
```
