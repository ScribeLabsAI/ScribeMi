Scribe Mi's documentation
=========================

This library allows the management of MI (Monitoring Information) in a
simple way.

You first need a Scribe account, an *id_token* and an *api_key*. The
account and the *api_key* can both be requested at
contact[atsign]scribelabs[dotsign]ai, and the *id_token* can be
generated by the user.

One way to generate the *id_token* is through
`ScribeAuth <https://github.com/ScribeLabsAI/scribeAuth>`__ library. The
function *get_tokens* will return a Dictionary with three different
tokens and it is necessary to extract the correct one to make it work
(*id_token*).

It is important to use the function *update_id_token* before calling any
other method of this library to avoid exceptions. If the *id_token* has
expired, it will be necessary to update it again.
